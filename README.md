If you are interested in contributing or taking over the project feel free to shoot me a message in the Mines ACM discord.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The project is deployed on cloudflare pages, and utilizes serverless tech (cloudflare workers) for data uploading and supabase for the postgres DB. Banner requests are proxied through an AWS EC2 instance.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
